# English-Text-Classification-using-GA-based-CNN
Deep learning-based techniques have been highly applied in the natural language processing domain. 
Among these techniques, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is one of the most efficient method that provides satisfactory performance. However, CNN faces a problem with handling its parameters.
This project aims to propose an efficient deep-learning model for text classification with context to movie reviews. This proposed model integrates CNN with the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize CNNâ€™s hyperparameters. 
The thought behind using CNNs for text classification revolves around their ability to capture local patterns and hierarchical representations in text data. 
GA can complement this by optimizing various aspects of the CNN model to enhance its performance. 
The objective sets to conduct a comparative study to validate the efficiency of the proposed model. 
Through experimental results, the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on the IMDB dataset for accuracy, f1- score, precision, and recall.
